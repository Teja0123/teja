In a mathematics, the proof utilized a concept called height Consider a fraction x/y.Its height is defined as the maximum of its numerator and denominator. So, for example, the height of 5/24 would be 24, and the height of 29/3 would be 29.

Given x and y, find the height of x/y.

Constraints:-100sa,bâ‰¤100.

Input Format: The only line of input contains two integers, x and y.

Output Format: Output a single integer, which is the height of x/y.

Sample I/O:

Input 1: 524

Output 1: 24

Input 2:








import java.util.*;
public class height{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    int x=sc.nextInt();
    int y=sc.nextInt();
    
    if( x > y){
        System.out.println(x);
    }
    else if(y > x){
        System.out.println(y);
    }
        
        
    }
}
